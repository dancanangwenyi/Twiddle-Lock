# Twiddle-Lock
You are tasked to develop the Twiddle Lock. In brief this is an electronic form of the classic ‘dial combination safe’ (or DCS as they call it in the trade) combinational lock mechanism. But in this project you will use a Raspberry-based application that will listen to a button that will indicate you are about to put in a ‘dialed code’, and this dialed code will be sensed by an ADC connected to a POT that is attached to the dial, or in our case just a knob that represents the ‘twiddle knob’
